          It's close to midnight
          <br />
          Something evil's lurking in the dark
          <br />
          Under the moonlight
          <br />
          You see a sight that almost stops <br />
          your heart
          <br />
          <br />
          You try to scream
          <br />
          But terror takes the sound before <br />
          you make it
          <br />
          You start to freeze
          <br />
          As horror looks you right between <br />
          the eyes
          <br />
          You're paralyzed
      </div>
